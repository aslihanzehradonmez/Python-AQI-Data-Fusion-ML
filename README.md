# Python AQI Data Fusion and ML Prediction

## 🎯 Project Summary

This repository implements a **Data Fusion** module in Python. The goal is to merge two distinct data sources *(Air Quality Sensor data and Meteorological data)* to create a robust feature set for predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) using a supervised machine learning model.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

The system performs **Temporal Fusion** by merging datasets on a common timestamp, followed by an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** process.
